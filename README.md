# ez-query
Kibana visualization that maintains a list of predefined Lucene Queries for easy selection in Dashboards

Lucene Queries are a powerful tool that unleases ElasticSearch. However, your average Kibana user will not understand the syntax and struggle crafting queries. EZ-query provides a simple kibana visualization that allows Dashboard authors to create a list of Lucene Queries that are then selectable from an easy to use GUI.
